# AdventsOfCode2022
 I am using the Advent of Code challenge to improve my skills in the Swift programming language. The goal is to solve all 25 tasks while applying various concepts and functions of Swift. 
 I am documenting my progress and solutions in this repository to help other developers who are also interested in learning Swift.
